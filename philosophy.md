#language processing philosophy

Wastefulness
The english language is full of wastefulness.  We use far more words than we need to in order to convey a message.  Some of this may be used for other humanistic requirements, but have nothing to do with the function that is being performed or pertain to the efficiency of its execution.  Other uses may be completely superfluous and serve no need whatsoever, but have arisen from the ever-evolving language over the years and decades for no reason whatsoever.

The following is a list of reasons for excessive language:
1. Politeness - To convey a sense of respect when making a request.
Reasons for this::
  - Conditioning - you're simply told to do this.
  - Increased effectiveness with human - A human is more willing to perform an action when they are felt to be respected
2. Protocol Interrupt - To stop the flow of communication on one track in order to re-focus on a new track.
Reaons for this::
  - Humans make take some readjustment to understand and process a new line of communication.  The message may be clear from the perspective of the statements being made (even with different subjects), but the human mind may need some "easing" into the new line of questioning.  Or, it could just be the etiquette to peform this easing.
3. Permissions - To obtain the necessary level of permissions/authority to make a request.
Reasons for this::
  - Any request cannot be made by any source.  A certain level of permissions must be obtained before making a type of request.
